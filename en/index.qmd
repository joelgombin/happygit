# Welcome {.unnumbered}

> "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."
>
> — **Andrej Karpathy**, February 2025

This guide is for **vibe coders**: developers who use AI agents like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or other assistants to write code. Whether you're an experienced developer exploring these new tools or a newcomer discovering programming through LLMs, this guide will help you master Git and GitHub in this new paradigm.

## Why this guide?

Traditional Git guides assume you write every line of code yourself. But the world has changed:

- **The agent writes, you supervise**: Your role evolves toward architecture, review, and direction
- **Diffs explode**: An agent can generate hundreds of lines in seconds
- **Traceability becomes crucial**: Who wrote what? Human or AI?
- **Errors propagate quickly**: An unfortunate "Accept All" can introduce subtle bugs

This guide gives you the tools and practices to navigate this new era confidently.

## What you'll learn

### Understanding the revolution
- Andrej Karpathy's **Software 3.0** paradigm
- The difference between *vibe coding* and AI-assisted development

### Mastering Git with agents
- Configuring Git for agent-assisted work
- Adapted branching strategies
- Atomic commits despite large changes

### Smart automation
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Asynchronous workflows à la Simon Willison
- Automated tests as a safety net

### Best practices
- Reviewing AI-generated code
- Security and secrets
- Troubleshooting common situations

## This guide's approach

Like its inspiration [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/), this guide is **opinionated**. Rather than presenting all possible options, we give you clear recommendations based on community experience.

## Our philosophy

**"Trust the AI, but verify the output."** — The vibe coder community

We believe AI agents are incredible force multipliers, but human judgment remains essential. Git and GitHub are your safety nets.
:::

## Prerequisites

- A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- An internet connection
- Curiosity and an open mind

No prior Git experience required. If you can already use a coding agent, you have the basics you need.

## How to use this guide

1. **Read sequentially** if you're just starting out
2. **Navigate by topic** if you're looking for a specific answer
3. **Experiment** with the provided examples
